# fft_demo
For testing only, not finished project! Maybe later I will continue...

- Arduino IDE, ESP32S
- 25x10 addressable LED
+ some audio input signal format cicuit, zero level is pushed to the middle of A/D range. 
2 potmeters to adjust input level

2 modes: 
- FFT display 
- Game of Life simulation (steps are directed by the music)


Ask, if you are interested...
